#### Working at a fund  

  * Futures trading - what's a future?
  * How do you know what a good price is?
    * Build a model, of course... this is where the quants come in
  * How do you set a lookback window?
    * Based off of industry, sector, 99% domain knowledge
    * Does it correlate with anything else? -- extremely risky!
    * Is the correlation lagged (rain & crops)
    * Knowledge of time series is important
  * Setup something to give a confidence interval on prices
    * Make a decision as to how risky you want to be
    * As prices move decide when to buy/sell


```{r}
ggplot(rain %>%
         filter(date > '2007-01-01'), 
       aes(x = date, y = pr, col=Country)) + geom_line()
```

```{r}
c = corn %>% 
  tbl_time(date) %>%
  as_period('monthly', side='start') %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::floor_date(date,'month'))

r = rain %>%
  select(date, Country, pr) %>%
  spread(Country, pr)

df = c %>%
  left_join(r, by = 'date') %>%
  rename(corn = value) %>%
  drop_na() #%>% gather(nam,val,-date)

p = ggplot(df) 
p + geom_point(aes(x = corn, y = AUS)) 
p + geom_point(aes(x = corn, y = BRA))
p + geom_point(aes(x = corn, y = USA))
```

```{r}
plot(df %>% select(-date))

#### Time series analysis:  

  * Stationary vs. Non-Stationary
  * Additive vs. Multiplicative
  * ARMA / ARIMA models
  * Filters: Kalman, Holt-Winters
  * Stochastic Processes, Random Walk, Wiener Process, Brownian Motion
  

#### What is a stationary time series?

"A time series is stationary if a shift in time doesn't cause a change in the shape of the distribution. Basic properties of the distribution like the mean, variance, and covariance are constant over time."

![Stationary vs Seasonal Time series - http://www.statisticshowto.com/stationarity/](image1.png)



#### Different types of stationarity:  

  * Strict Stationarity - basically doesn't exist... essentially nothing changes based off of time...
  * First-Order Stationarity - means never change, but other statistics can change
  * Second-Order (Weak) Stationarity - constant mean, variance, and autocovariance that doesn't change with time 
  * Trend-Stationary Models - fluctuate around deterministic trend (series mean). Trend is typically linear or quadratic, amplitude of fluctuations stays constant
  * Difference-Stationary Models - one or more differences of the data need to be taken to make it stationary


#### Why do we care about stationarity?  

Most statistical models that have been developed assume stationarity.

# Example from: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/12/complete-tutorial-time-series-modeling/
AirPassengers
```


```{r}
plot(AirPassengers)
abline(reg = lm(AirPassengers ~ time(AirPassengers)))
```


```{r}
#convert to df for rolling operations
ap = matrix(AirPassengers, nco = 1)
t1 = as.integer(min(time(AirPassengers)))
t2 = as.integer(max(time(AirPassengers)))
y = sort(rep(seq(from = t1, to = t2, by = 1), t2-t1 + 1))
m = rep(seq(from = 1, to = 12, by = 1), t2-t1 + 1)
apdf = tibble(year = y, month = m, passengers = ap[,1])
apdf = apdf %>% mutate(date = as.Date(paste0(year,'-',month,'-01'))) %>%
  select(date,passengers)
```


```{r}
#remove last 3 years of data
apdf_3 = apdf %>% mutate(x = 1:nrow(apdf)) %>% filter(date < '1958-01-01')
ts_fit = lm(passengers ~ x, data = apdf_3)
ts_fit
```



```{r}
intercept = ts_fit$coefficients[1]
slope = ts_fit$coefficients[2]

apdf_prediction = apdf_3 %>% mutate(type = 'historical') %>%
  bind_rows(apdf %>% filter(date >= '1958-01-01') %>% mutate(type='actual')) %>%
  mutate(x = 1:nrow(apdf)) %>%
  mutate(prediction = (x*slope) + intercept)

ggplot(apdf_prediction, aes(x=date, y=passengers, col=type)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_line(aes(y=prediction), col='black')
```





```{r}
rolling_mean = rollify(mean, window = 8)
tmp = apdf %>% mutate(ma = rolling_mean(passengers)) %>% drop_na()
ggplot(tmp, aes(x=date)) + geom_line(aes(y=passengers)) + geom_line(aes(y=ma), col = 'red')
```



### Decomposition Example  

#### Multiplicative model  

#### Forecast = Trend * Seasonality * Cycle * Error

[Decomposition Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gf4ZMhKsmBO_pSSXYg0XdKQKTsIWRbNsEIXn_08BqUg/edit?usp=sharing)




### Do transformations!

```{r}
plot(log(AirPassengers))
```

```{r}
plot(diff(AirPassengers))
```


```{r}
plot(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
```



```{r}
adf.test(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
```

```{r}
acf(log(AirPassengers))
```

#### ACF is good for identifying MA component
```{r}
acf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
```


#### PACF is good for identifying AR component
```{r}
pacf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
```

## The ARIMA Model

#### Function of (p,d,q)

#### AR -- p -- number of lags
#### I -- d -- number of differences
#### MA -- q -- error of the model as a combination of previous error terms

Non-Seasonal ARIMA Model is built:
![ARIMA](arima.png)  

</center>
  
  
```{r}
fit <- arima(log(AirPassengers), 
             order = c(0, 1, 1))
pred <- predict(fit, n.ahead = 10*12)
ts.plot(AirPassengers,2.718^pred$pred, log = "y", lty = c(1,3))
```


#### 

```{r}
fit <- arima(log(AirPassengers), 
             order = c(0, 1, 1),
             seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), 
                             period = 12))

pred <- predict(fit, n.ahead = 10*12)
ts.plot(AirPassengers,2.718^pred$pred, log = "y", lty = c(1,3))
```





```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dow = tq_index("DOW") %>%
  tq_get(get = "stock.prices") %>%
  drop_na()
head(dow, 10)
```


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p = ggplot(dow, aes(x = date, y = close, col = symbol)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  gghighlight(max(close) > 250) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  facet_wrap(~ symbol)
print(p)
```



## Is BA a stationary time series?

#### Can you simply zoom in and find a portion that is stationary?
```{r}
ba = dow %>% 
  filter(symbol == 'BA') %>% 
  select(date, close)
plotly::ggplotly(ggplot(ba, aes(x = date, y = close)) + geom_line() + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE))
```


```{r}
adf.test(zoo::zoo(ba$close, ba$date))
```



```{r}
ts_fit = lm(close ~ date, data = ba)
ts_fit
```


```{r}
res = tibble(residuals = resid(ts_fit))
ggplot(res, aes(x = 1:nrow(res), y = residuals)) + geom_point() + geom_rug(sides = 'l')
```

```{r}
ggplot(res, aes(x = residuals)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 40) + geom_density(col = 'red', size = 1.5)
```






#### Are the daily returns stationary?

```{r}
ret = ba %>%
  tq_transmute(close, mutate_fun = dailyReturn)
ggplot(ret, aes(x = date, y = daily.returns)) + geom_line() + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)
```


```{r}
adf.test(zoo::zoo(ret$daily.returns, ret$date))
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
log_close = ba %>% 
  mutate(log_close = log(close)) %>%
  mutate(daysFromStart = 1:nrow(ba))
lc = log_close %>%
  select(daysFromStart, close, log_close) %>%
  gather(price_type, close, -daysFromStart)

ggplot(lc, 
       aes(daysFromStart, close)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  # Here comes the gganimate code
  transition_states(
    price_type,
    transition_length = 2,
    state_length = 1
  ) +
  view_follow()
```

# Differenced log?
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
log_close = ba %>% 
  mutate(close = close / 100) %>% # divide by 100 for animation purposes
  mutate(log_close = log(close),
         log_close_diff = 10 * (log_close - lag(log_close))) %>% # multiply by 10 for animation purposes
  mutate(daysFromStart = 1:nrow(ba))

lc = log_close %>%
  select(daysFromStart, close, log_close, log_close_diff) %>%
  gather(price_type, close, -daysFromStart) %>%
  drop_na()

ggplot(lc, 
       aes(daysFromStart, close)) + 
  geom_point(col = 'darkgreen', alpha = 0.5) + 
  # Here comes the gganimate code
  transition_states(
    price_type,
    transition_length = 2,
    state_length = 1
  )
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(lc, 
       aes(close)) + 
  geom_density(fill = 'darkgreen', alpha = 0.25) + 
  # Here comes the gganimate code
  transition_states(
    price_type,
    transition_length = 2,
    state_length = 1
  )

```


```{r}
lc = ba %>% 
  mutate(close = close) %>% # divide by 100 for animation purposes
  mutate(log_close = log(close),
         log_close_diff = log_close - lag(log_close)) %>%
  drop_na()

ggplot(lc, aes(x = log_close_diff)) + geom_histogram(bins = 40)
```
